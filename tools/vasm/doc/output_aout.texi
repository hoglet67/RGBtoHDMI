This chapter describes the a.out output module which can be
selected with the @option{-Faout} option.

@section Legal

    This module is written in 2008-2012 by Frank Wille and
    is covered by the vasm copyright without modifications.

@section Additional options for this module
 
@table @option
    @item -mid=<machine id>
        Sets the MID field of the a.out header to the specified value.
        The MID defaults to 2 (Sun020 big-endian) for M68k and to 100
        (PC386 little-endian) for x86.

@section General

This output module outputs the @code{a.out} (assembler output)
format, which is an older 32-bit format for Unix-like operating systems,
originally invented by AT&T.

@section Restrictions

The @code{a.out} output format, as implemented in vasm, currently supports
the following architectures:

@itemize @minus
@item M68k
@item i386
@end itemize

The following standard relocations are supported by default:
@itemize @minus
@item absolute, 8, 16, 32 bits
@item pc-relative, 8, 16, 32 bits
@item base-relative
@end itemize

Standard relocations occupy 8 bytes and don't include an addend, so they
are not suitable for most RISC CPUs. The extended relocations format occupies
12 bytes and also allows more relocation types.

@section Known Problems

    Some known problems of this module at the moment:

@itemize @minus
@item Support for stab debugging symbols is still missing.
@item The extended relocation format is not supported.
@end itemize

@section Error Messages

This module has the following error messages:

@item 3008: output module doesn't allow multiple sections of the same type
@item 3010: section <%s>: alignment padding (%lu) not a multiple of %lu at 0x%llx
